<p>I have decided to create the SPA with React. Therefore, here are the steps to run the application locally (please note that node.js needs to be installed on your machine):</p>

<ul>
<li>1- Open the terminal and, in the folder of your choice, run npx create-react-app my-photos-app</li>
<li>2- Once the folder for the application is created, open it and replace the src folder with the one sent.</li>
<li>3- I have added some extra node packages (one for Sass and another for react-router-dom) so before running the app, type the following commands on the terminal :
  - npm install react-router-dom
  - npm install sass
</li>
<li>4- The code base is finally ready. To be able to see the SPA in your browser, please type : 
  - npm run start
The SPA will automatically open in your browser, in http://localhost:3000/</li>
</ul>
